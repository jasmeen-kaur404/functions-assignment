    "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both functions and methods are blocks of reusable code designed to perform specific tasks. However, they differ primarily in their contexts and usage. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions vs. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Function:\n",
    "Definition: A function is a block of code that is defined using the def keyword and is independent of any object. It can be called directly by its name.\n",
    "Scope: Functions can exist outside of classes and can be called directly.\n",
    "Example: A function that calculates the square of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "Definition: A method is similar to a function but is associated with an object and defined within a class. Methods are invoked on instances of the class (objects).\n",
    "Scope: Methods are defined within classes and operate on instances of those classes.\n",
    "Example: A method within a class that calculates the area of a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Function and Method\n",
    "# Function example\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function\n",
    "print(\"Square of 5 is:\", square(5))  # Output: Square of 5 is: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method example within a class\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",

    "# Creating an instance of Rectangle\n",
    "rect = Rectangle(4, 5)\n",

    "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, function arguments and parameters are fundamental concepts used to pass information to functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "Parameters are variables listed in a function's definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called. Parameters define what kind of data the function expects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments\n",
    "Arguments are the actual values or expressions passed to the function when it is called. They replace the parameters in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "def greet(name, age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Function that takes two parameters: name and age.\n",
    "    It prints a greeting message using these parameters.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",

    "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions can be defined and called in several ways. Here are the different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standard Function Definition\n",
    "This is the most common way to define and call functions. It uses the def keyword to define a function and the function name followed by parentheses to call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# Function definition\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function call\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lambda Functions\n",
    "Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are often used for short, throwaway functions where a full function definition is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# Lambda function definition\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lambda function call\n",
    "result = add(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functions with Default Parameters\n",
    "You can define functions with default parameter values. If the caller does not provide a value for these parameters, the default value is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# Function definition with default parameters\n",
    "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function calls\n",
    "greet()         # Uses default parameter\n",
    "greet(\"Bob\")    # Overrides default parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Functions with Variable-Length Arguments\n",
    "Functions can accept a variable number of arguments using *args for positional arguments and **kwargs for keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# Function definition with *args and **kwargs\n",
    "def print_details(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    print(\"Positional arguments:\", args)\n",
    "    print(\"Keyword arguments:\", kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function call\n",
    "print_details(1, 2, 3, name=\"Alice\", age=30)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recursive Functions\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself. This is useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# Recursive function definition\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",

    "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function with one example\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement in a Python function serves several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs a Value: It specifies the value that the function will return to the caller. Without a return statement, a function will return None by default.\n",
    "Exits the Function: It terminates the function's execution and sends the control back to the caller. After the return statement, any code in the function is not executed.\n",
    "Example\n",

    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, iterators and iterables are related concepts used to traverse through a collection of items. However, they have distinct roles and characteristics. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterables\n",
    "Iterables are objects that can be iterated over, meaning they can return an iterator. An iterable is any object that implements the __iter__() method or has a __getitem__() method (for sequences).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Iterables: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators\n",
    "Iterators are objects that represent a stream of data. They are used to traverse through the elements of an iterable. An iterator is an object that implements both the __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Iterator: Any object that is returned by the iter() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Iterable: An object that can return an iterator. It provides a __iter__() method.\n",
    "Iterator: An object that performs the iteration. It provides __iter__() (returns itself) and __next__() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "Iterable: Can be used to create an iterator but cannot be directly used to fetch items.\n",
    "Iterator: Can be used to fetch the next item in the sequence and keeps track of the current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "# Example of an iterable\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # List is an iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an iterator from the iterable\n",
    "iterator = iter(numbers)   # Get an iterator from the list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the iterator to access elements\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",

    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, generators are a special type of iterator that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values, but unlike lists or other collections, they generate values on-the-fly and do not store them in memory. This makes generators particularly useful for handling large datasets or streams of data where you don't want to store everything in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept of Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators:\n",
    "Definition: Functions that return an iterator using the yield keyword. They generate values one at a time and only when needed.\n",
    "Benefits: They are memory-efficient because they yield items one at a time and do not require storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Generators Work:\n",
    "When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator but does not start execution immediately.\n",

    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or when a function needs to produce a sequence of values. Here are some key advantages of using generators, along with an example to illustrate these benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Generators\n",
    "Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "Generators: Yield one item at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory. This is particularly useful for handling large datasets or streams of data.\n",
    "Regular Functions: Typically generate and return a complete list or collection, which can be memory-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "Generators: Compute values on-the-fly only when they are needed. This means values are produced just-in-time, reducing the initial computation and memory usage.\n",
    "Regular Functions: Compute and store all values at once, even if only a few are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Infinite Sequences:\n",
    "Generators: Can handle infinite sequences since they only generate values on-demand and don’t need to store the entire sequence.\n",
    "Regular Functions: Cannot handle infinite sequences because they would require storing all values in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler Code:\n",
    "Generators: Simplify the implementation of iterators, as the yield keyword handles both state management and value production.\n",
    "Regular Functions: Require more code to manage the state of an iterator and explicitly handle iteration.\n",
